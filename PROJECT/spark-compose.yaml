  # To test the Spark cluster, we could run scripts having the host machine be
  # the driver. However, because the containers in the compose are isolated on
  # their own network, the IPs to access the data from the host machine and the
  # workers are different. To solve this, we'll run a Jupyter notebook server
  # inside the Spark cluster. This way, the driver will be inside the same
  # network as the workers.
